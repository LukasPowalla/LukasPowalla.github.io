# Goal

I will work on tools that might allow for automated literature research on specific topics, visualize content and author connections and create new insights. In the future, this might allow to find answers to questions that we are not yet able to pose. 

# Scientific Background

As a solid state scientist with interests in novel computing concepts in "classical" computing such as spintronics and neuromorphic computing, I am interested to bring together the hardwareside with the softwareside. Especially in the field of spintronics, I have a strong background on 2D materials, especially 2D magnets on which I wrote my dissertation titled "Spin Textures inn 2D Magnets". 

# Where and What

In the next time, I will work on the PubliPy repository, which aims to automate and visualize literature research from google scholar in realtime.
